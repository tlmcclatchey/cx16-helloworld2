# cx16-helloworld2
HelloWorld2 assembly application for the Commander X16

HelloWorld2 is a modified version of the typical Hello, World! application but instead of simply displaying the customary message, this application will first prompt the user for their name, then say "Hello, Name!"

The primary intent for writing this application is trying to understand how input and output routines work

This code is written for the 65xx processor primarily targeting the Commander X16 architecture.
